# Advancing with data visualization in R using `ggplot2`

Data + Code for **"Basic data visualization in R"** and **"Advancing with data visualization in R using `ggplot2`"** at the [Data+Narrative](http://www.bu.edu/com/data-narrative/) storytelling workshops at Boston University on Thursday, June 7th 2018.

Note the "Advancing with data visualization in R using `ggplot2`" workshop is ~90% the same as a workshop on the same topic I gave at BU last year.

Equivalent materials for **"Tricks for cleaning your data in R"** available, from 2017, are [here](https://github.com/underthecurve/r-data-cleaning-tricks).
